#Intro/Demo-Game/Final Project

#Now, looking at the game, I'm sure some people are going to be confused as to what commands are usable for each section and part. Moreover, this file will
#discuss some of the pieces that were used throughout the process of making this program.

#Firstly, this program is not the most complex of files, it is a long, and tedious to read file, as it sequences multiple events that are not squared down,
#usually, into 'else' when it doesn't need to be. Most of the program runs off of the simple variables and input program, using many, many, many variables
#in order to make sure nothing interacts negatively with the other.

#Before I start going into inputs, I want the reader to know the program will crash if an input is used that is not selectable. As such, the text tends to
#point evidence torwards what commands should be typed.

#Next: These are the following selectable inputs at certain scenes.

#Door Choices: "Left", "Right", "Front"

#Left Door Choices:

#Answer the Goblin's Question: "Apple", and any other input.
#Answer the Goblin's Offer: "Yes", "No", and any other input.
#Eating the Apple: "Pretend", "Eat".
#Left Door Giant's Quiz: "Giant", "Human", and any other input.
#Left Door Giant's Fight: "Run Away", "Fight Giant", "Run for Sword".

#Front Door Choices:

#Mysterious Puzzle Room: "Touch Red Orb", "Touch Yellow Orb", "Touch Blue Orb", "Look Around", "Move Forward".
#Front Door Giant's Quiz: "Giant", "Human", and any other input.
#Front Door Giant's Fight: "Run Away", "Fight Giant", "Run for Sword".

#Right Door Choices:

#Large Wolf Encounter: "Sneak", "Pet".
#Small Dogs Encounter: "Pet Dogs", "Run Past Dogs", "Yell at Dogs", "Engage Dog Fight".
#Right Door Giant's Quiz: "Giant", "Human", and any other input.
#Right Door Giant's Fight: "Run Away", "Fight Giant", "Run for Sword". 

#That is all the current encounters for this dungeon! In my spare time, I hope to work on this adding more and more features that I have learned about in
#the Python languages. One day, I will expand this dungeon to have far more rooms, and much less repetitive encounters, much more meaningful puns, and much
#better dialogue options that improve along with my writing. Thank you for reading this, and hope you have a pleasant day!
